<ul> <h2> <center>Law of Stoichiometry:</center></h2>
    <li><mark>Law of Conservation of mass: </mark> </li>
    <b>ans.</b>It states that, "The total mass of reactants is equal to the total mass of products in a chemical reaction."
    <li> <mark>Law of Constant composition or definite Proportion</mark></li>
    <b>ans.</b>It states that, "A particular compound is always composed of same kind of elements combined together in a definite proportion by weight regardless of it's origin or mode of formation of compound. "
    <li><mark> Law of Multiple Proportion </mark></li>
    <b>ans.</b>It states that, "When one element combines with another element to form two or more compound, the mass of one element that combines with the constant mass of another element bears a simple whole number ratio with one another. "
    <li><mark> Law of Reciprocal Proportion:</mark> </li>
    <b>ans.</b>It states that, "The mass of two element which combines seprately with the fixed mass of third element, are in the ratio  either same or some multiple of the ratio, in which they combine with each other."
    <li><mark>GayLussac's Law of Gaseous Volume:</mark> </li>
    <b>ans.</b>It states that, At a similar condition of temperature and pressure the volume of gaseous reactants(and, products also if gases)bears a simple whole number ratio.
</ul>
<h3><center>Faraday's Law of Electrolysis:</center></h3>
<ul>
    <li><mark>Faraday's First Law of Electrolysis</mark></li>
    <b>ans.</b>It states that, "The amount of substance deposited or liberated in an electrode  during electrolysis is directly proportional to the amount of  charge passed into it."
    <li><mark>Faraday's Second Law of Electrolysis</mark></li>
    <b>ans.</b>It states that,"If same amount of electricity is passed into different electrolytes with their electrodes connected in the series, the amount of substance deposited in the respective electrodes is directly proportional to their chemical equivalent or equivalent weight."

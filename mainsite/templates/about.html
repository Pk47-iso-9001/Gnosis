       If I have to talk about this website, It took me around 2 weeks to build it. I thought to build this website so that I can enhance the knowledge of django. But this website taught me more about html and Css. Here In this website, I have used basic of django in backend, I thought not to use Javascript while making this website but to add a feature(to create a Light Box) here in this website Javascript was must, I just copied some Javascript code from other Website(W3School). It's not like I totally build this website from my side, I copied few codes from some other webiste. The image in home page where it flip if you hover is just from W3School and the code from Question Paper page is also from there. Previoulsy, I thought I should keep all the question paper in one page. But It was not working properly, like when I do that then we can only see the question paper from some division only. It was the major complication I faced while making this website, every way I thought that it will work was not working, they made the issue even bad. I couldn't figure out whether the problem was in the Html or Css or Javascript code. So I thought to make a seprate page for each  subject question paper. And, It works.<br>
       So Yeah! If you find the way that helps us to make this website more beneficial, then it will be highly acceptable.</p>

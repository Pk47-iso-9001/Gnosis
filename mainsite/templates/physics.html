  <ul> <h2> <center>Some Definations & Laws from Heat:</center></h2>
    <li><mark>Newton's Law of Cooling: </mark> </li>
    <b>ans.</b>It states that, "The rate of loss of heat is directly proportional to the difference of temperature of a body and its surrounding."
    <li> <mark>Stefan's  Law of Black Body Radiation:</mark></li>
    <b>ans.</b>It states that, "The total amount of heat energy radiated per second per unit surface area of a perfect black body is directly proportional to the fourth power  of the absolute temperature of the surface of the body. "
    <li><mark> Stefan-Boltzman law of Black Body Radiation: </mark></li>
    <b>ans.</b>It states that, "The total amount of heat energy radiated per second per  unit surgace area of a perfect black body is directly proportional to the difference of fourth power of absolute temperature of the body and its surroundings.
    <li><mark> Relegation:</mark> </li>
    <b>ans.</b>It is the phenomenon of melting under pressure and freezing again when pressure is reduced. It was discovered by Michael Faraday.
    <li><mark>Triple Point:</mark> </li>
    <b>ans.</b>It is defined as the point in the phase diagram at which all three states of the substance coexist.
